    <summary>Help! A friend is suicidal!</summary>
    <p>If you don't think they are actively making an attempt, dial 811 and talk to the suicide hotline.
    <b>If you feel they are in immediate danger to themselves, dial 911.</b> The best thing to do is keep them
    talking to you. Ask them things about themselves, have them focus on their surroundings, and things of that nature.
    <b>If they stop responding after 5 minutes, dial 911 and inform the operator of the situation.</b></p>

    <summary>Help! My friend made a suicide attempt!</summary>
    <p>Dial 911 right away. If they are bleeding, wrap a shirt or other cloth tightly around the wound - the more sterile
    the cloth the better. Don't use a shirt you've worn for the day as it risks infection, but rather a clean piece of
    cloth. Your shirt should be the last resort. If they have overdosed, lie them on their side and loosen any tight clothing.
    If they are on a high building or bridge, call 911 right away, as someone experienced in suicide prevention will need
    to assist. Remember: Always keep them talking.</p>
